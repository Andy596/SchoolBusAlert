# SchoolBusAlert
SchoolBusAlert is an automated bus tracking system that logs into Twitter (X), scrapes tweets for bus departure updates, and sends SMS alerts when a specific bus (2018) is mentioned. It ensures alerts are only sent if the tweet is recent and runs within a set time window. Built with Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and SMTP for notifications.
